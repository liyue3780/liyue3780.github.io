I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Radiology](https://www3.pennmedicine.org/departments-and-centers/department-of-radiology) at [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/), affiliated with the [Penn Image Computing and Science Laboratory](https://picsl.upenn.edu/) and the PATCH Lab. I am advised by [Prof. Paul Yushkevich](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p2693923), [Prof. David Wolk](https://pennmemorycenter.org/who-we-are/staff/david-wolk-md/) and [Prof. Sandhitsu Das](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p5478761). My research focuses on designing Alzheimer's disease imaging biomarkers in multi-modality imaging data.

Before joining UPenn, I got my Ph.D. in Computational Mathematics from Sun Yat-sen University in 2022, under Prof. Yao Lu at Computational Medical Imaging Laboratory where I worked on computer-aided diagnosis for breast cancer in screening images. I received my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Sun Yat-sen University in 2017.
